Effect Size Calculator for Meta-analysis

This github repository is for the code associated with my effect size calculator. This calculator computes Cohen's $d$, odds ratio, risk ratio, and correlation coefficient type effect sizes. It is a companion to my book call _Practical Meta-analysis_ co-authored with Mark Lipsey.

I created this as a place to work on making updates. A functioning version of the calculator can be found at https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/research-resources/effect-size-calculator.html
